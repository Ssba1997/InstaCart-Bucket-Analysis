# InstaCart Bucket Analysis
## Description:
This repository contains the Customer Retention Analysis project, where Python is used to analyze customer data, identify churn risk factors, and build predictive models to enhance customer retention strategies. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to predict which customers are most likely to leave the company.
# Overview
Customer retention is a major challenge for businesses, and predicting churn allows companies to take proactive measures. This project leverages Python to analyze customer data, extract insights, and build machine learning models that classify customers as either likely to stay or leave.

The dataset contains customer details such as demographics, account details, and transaction history, which are used to uncover patterns in customer behavior.
 # Key Features
 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing customer churn trends using libraries like Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Feature Engineering – Transforming raw data into meaningful features for model training.

Machine Learning Models – Building classification models to predict customer churn.

Model Evaluation – Using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores to assess performance.
# Technologies Used
Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook  (for data analysis & visualization)
Machine Learning Models  (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
GitHub (for version control and project documentation)
# Folder Structure
Project Management: Project brief

Data: Contains two subfolders 'IC24 Original Data' with original datasets, and 'IC24 Prepared Data' with cleaned datasets ready for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)

Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.

Analysis: 'Visualizations' subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.

Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.
